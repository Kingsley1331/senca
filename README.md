## Structure
Each pair of questions such as **Hot or Cold** is a self contained component.
These components are rendered dynamically from data in the **questions** object from the top level state in the App component.
To see how this works uncomment the pets object in the state (line 47 in src/App.js), after doing this a new pair of options **Cat or Dog** will appear. You can add as many options as you want and they will all be rendered.
